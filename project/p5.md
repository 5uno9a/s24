# Sparrow Stage P5: Copying and Moving

In this stage, you'll create a NamedIntColumn type that has a string
`name` and `col` that points to a `IntColumn` object (from last
stage).  You'll practice moving and copying in this project.
Normally, `name` and `col` would be private, but you'll make them
public for this project so that the tests can more easily verify
you're doing the correct thing.

You should add this to `sparrow.h`:

```cpp
  class NamedIntColumn {
  public:
    std::string name = "";
    IntColumn* col = nullptr;

    NamedIntColumn(const std::string& name, const std::vector<std::string>& inputs);
    NamedIntColumn(const NamedIntColumn& other);
    NamedIntColumn(NamedIntColumn&& other);
    void operator=(const NamedIntColumn& other);
    void operator=(NamedIntColumn&& other);
    ~NamedIntColumn();
  };
```

Then implement those functions in `sparrow.cpp`.

Assume that there is only ever one pointer from a `NamedIntColumn` to
an `IntColumn` -- this means that a `NamedIntColumn` should delete the
`IntColumn` (if there is one) upon its own destruction.  It also means
that copying a `NamedIntColumn` must involve copying the `IntColumn`
as well.

When moving, the target `NamedIntColumn` should "steal" the pointer
from `other.col`.  Note that `std::string` also supports moving -- your
move implementations should take advantage of that.
